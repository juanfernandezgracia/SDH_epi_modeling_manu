## Theoretical framework

One point to take into account is that deaths in residencies for the elder have their own logic and thus should be treated differently in the analysis. 
*Health care workers pose a similar challenge in the analysis and modeling. (???)*
Regarding the rest of the population one can divide the social determinants impacting their risk during an epidemic at least into the following classes and subclasses:

1. **Inequality**. Indices that reflect material deprivation.
  - *Housing*. Overcrowding is a driver of contagion.
  - *Unemployment*. Unemployment leads to lower income levels and thus material deprivation, but also to lower mobility.
  - *Occupation*. Depending on the type of job, working from home can be possible or not.
2. **Population density**. A crowded living environment leads also to an enhanced frequency of close contacts, fostering contagion.
3. **Public transport**. The use of public transport modes is also a strong driver of close contacts, leading again to high contagion risks.
