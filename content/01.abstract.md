## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Social determinants of health are typically not taken into account when building mathematical models of infectious diseases.
Here we address this issue by first analysing data on social determinants and their relation to COVID-19 prevalence and then by developing mechanistic models that take into account social determinants explicitly, in order to exemplify how to do it and their consequences.
