### Model A: increasing connectivity for mixing the populations

I will use a basic SIR model with two subpopulations with sizes $N_A$ and $N_B$. Each population is divided into $S^x$, $I^x$ and $R^x$, with $x\in\{A,B\}$. In one timestep each agent from $x$ sees $k_xy$ agents from $y$ ($x, y \in \{A, B\}$). If an $S^x$ agent meets an $I^y$ agent, the $S^x$ gets the infection with probability $\lambda_{xy}$ ($x, y \in \{A, B\}$). The infected agents $I^x$ recover to $R^x$ at a rate $\mu_x$ ($x \in \{A, B\}$). If we redefine the parameters as $\lambda_{xy}k_{xy} = \beta_{xy}$ and express the numbers as proportions of each subpopulation, we get the following meanfield equations:
\begin{align}
\frac{ds^x}{dt} &= -\sum_{y\in\{A, B\}}\beta_{xy}s^xi^y, \\
\frac{di^x}{dt} &= \sum_{y\in\{A, B\}}\beta_{xy}s^xi^y -\mu_x i^x, \\
\frac{dr^x}{dt} &= \mu_x i^x, \\
\end{align}
with $s^x + i^x + r^x = 1$. Therefore we can get rid of the equations for s^x and keep with the system of equations:
\begin{align}
\frac{di^x}{dt} &= \sum_{y\in\{A, B\}}\beta_{xy}(1 - i^x - r^x)i^y -\mu_x i^x \\
\frac{dr^x}{dt} &= \mu_x i^x. \\
\end{align}
If we linearize the equations for $i^x$ we get the following system ($\vec{i} = (i^A, i^B)$):
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\vec{i}}{dt} = \begin{pmatrix}
\beta_{AA}-\mu_A & \beta_{AB} \\
\beta_{BA} & \beta_{BB}-\mu_B 
\end{pmatrix} \vec{i}.
\end{equation}
We can also define the parameters $R_0^x = 1 + \beta_{xx}-\mu_x$ to get:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\vec{i}}{dt} = \begin{pmatrix}
R_0^A-1 & \beta_{AB} \\
\beta_{BA} & R_0^B-1
\end{pmatrix} \vec{i}.
\end{equation}
With this parametrization we have the usual $R_0$ for the two subpopulations when they are decoupled ($\beta_{xy} = 0$ for $x, y \in\{A,B\}$ and $x\neq y$).
The eigenvalues of the linearized dynamics are (assuming $R_0^B > R_0^A$):
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\pm} = \frac{1}{2}(R_0^A+R_0^B) -1 \pm \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{(R_0^B-R_0^A)^2+4\beta_{AB}\beta_{BA}}.
\end{equation}
In order to have an outbreak we need at least that the largest eigenvalue is bigger than 0 ($\lambda_+ > 0$).
Note also that asymmetric versions of the model with $\beta_{AB}\neq \beta_{BA}$ can be put in a symmetric form with $\beta^*_{AB}= \sqrt{\beta_{AB}\beta_{BA}}$, at least for the study of the stability of the system.
As we increase the connectivity between the populations $\beta_{AB}$ and $\beta_{BA}$ the region with no outbreak in parameter space $R_0^A-R_0^A$ shrinks (see Fig. 1).
This effect is due to the increased connectivity.
A case similar to this might happen to the healthcare workers, as they tend to see more infected patients than usual during the epidemic. The precise way of introducing this should be through conditional probabilities of meeting an infected individual, but I have the feeling that this can be casted just as having more contacts.

### Model B: fixed degrees for each population and mixing parameter

For this model we also use an SIR model with two populations $A$ and $B$ of sizes $N_A$ and $N_B$. 
Agents in each population $X\in\{A, B\}$ are divided into the fractions of susceptible, $s^X$, infected $i^X$ and recovered $r^X$. 
Agents in population $X$ have a fixed degree $k_X$, so that a fraction $f_X$ of those contacts are with the other population. 
Whenever a susceptible from population $X$ meets an infected from population $Y$, the probability of transmission of the disease is $\lambda_{XY}$. 
Infected individuals in population $X$ transition to recovered ones with a rate $\mu_X$. 
The dynamical equations describing the system are
\begin{align}
\frac{ds^X}{dt} &= -(1-f_X)\lambda_{XX}k_Xs^Xi^X -f_X\lambda_{XY}k_Xs^Xi^Y, \\
\frac{di^X}{dt} &= (1-f_X)\lambda_{XX}k_Xs^Xi^X +f_X\lambda_{XY}k_Xs^Xi^Y -\mu_Xi^X, \\
\frac{dr^X}{dt} &= \mu_Xi^X,
\end{align}
with $X,Y \in \{A, B\}$, $X\neq Y$. Note also that, as $s^X+i^X+r^X=1$ we can get rid of one equation. If we eliminate the equation for susceptible individuals and linearize the equation for the infected we get the following equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\vec{i}}{dt} = \begin{pmatrix} 
(1-f_A)\lambda_{AA}k_A-\mu_A & f_A\lambda_{AB}k_A\\
f_B\lambda_{BA}k_B & (1-f_B)\lambda_{BB}k_B-\mu_B
\end{pmatrix}\vec{i},
\end{equation}
where $\vec{i}=(i^A, i^B)$. 
From this equation we can study the stability of the disease-free solution, so that when the largest eigenvalue is positive, we have a global outbreak.
With these parametrization of the model we can study diverse ways of encoding different SDH's for the two populations.
The difference in $\lambda$'s can reflect different levels of hygiene or access to hygienic measures, both inside populations or across as for example with a population of healthcare workers; difference in $\mu$'s reflects a difference in the duration of the disease, which could be caused by different access to healthcare, drugs, etc; difference in $k$'s reflectinf a different number of contacts, which could be dou to the need to contact other people to get basic needs or the constraints of a workplace (healthcare workers might need to see many patients); difference in $f$'s, *i.e.* mixing, as a result of the social or work structure.

In order to get some insight into the model, let's fix some quantities. 
We set $\mu_A=\mu_B=\mu$, setting the same length of the disease; $k_A=k_B=k$, fixing the same number of contacts; $\lambda_{AB} = \lambda_{BA} = \lambda_{mix}$, setting the same infectivity from A to B and viceversa; and $f_A=f_B=f$, fixing the same mixing for both populations. 
If we rescale time with $\mu$, we get for the linearized equation for infected individuals 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\vec{i}}{dt} = \begin{pmatrix} 
(1-f_A)R_0^A-1 & f_AR_{mix}\\
f_BR_{mix} & (1-f_B)R_0^B-1
\end{pmatrix}\vec{i},
\end{equation}
where we have defined
\begin{align}
R_0^A &= \frac{\lambda_{AA}k}{\mu}\\
R_0^B &= \frac{\lambda_{BB}k}{\mu}\\
R_{mix} &= \frac{\lambda_{mix}k}{\mu}.
\end{align}
The eigenvalues for the linearized equation are
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\pm} = \frac{1}{2}(1-f)(R_0^A+R_0^B)-1\pm\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{(1-f)^2(R_0^B-R_0^A)^2+4f^2R_{mix}^2}.
\end{equation}
When we do the cases $f=0$ we see that the $R_0$'s are the usual ones, so that when the populations are isolated there is outbreak for $R_0>1$. If we do the case $f=1$ we see that $R_mix$ has a similar meaning for when there is only mixing, as there will be outbreak only if $R_{mix}>1$. We can play now with the thre $R$'s and the mixing parameter $f$. To see the stability of the system as a function of these parameters, see Figs. 2 and 3.

Another way to look at the largest eigenvalue is to define an effective reproduction number, $R_{eff} = \lambda_++1$.
It takes the form
\begin{equation}
R_{eff}=\frac{1}{2}(1-f)(R_0^A+R_0^B)+\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{(1-f)^2(R_0^B-R_0^A)^2+4f^2R_{mix}^2}.
\end{equation}
It can be seen as a function of $R_0^A$ and different parametrizations of $R_0^B(R_0^A)$ (shown in color lines in Fig. 2) and for different values of $R_{mix}$ in Figs. 4 and 5.
