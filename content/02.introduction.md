## Introduction

Social determinants of health are defined as the economic and social conditions that influence individual and group differences in health status. 

The general idea behind this work is that social determinants of health are crucial for the understanding of the different impacts of an epidemic on different social groups. 
It is clear during the present pandemic at the level of countries, that healthy ones are able to apply social distancing and hygiene measures that are much more difficult -or even impossible- in developing countries. 
This is also true at lower scales as within countries or even within cities (**cite papers inequalities and COVID-19 in the US**).
Many mathematical modeling efforts have been made for the forecasting of epidemics, but only few have incorporated social determinants of health into them explicitly.
